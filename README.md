Matemasie is a commissioned open source Latin typeface that will include initially just a handful of African-specific characters, It is planned to have about 330–350 glyphs when it is fully done,but perhaps more next year, for Google Fonts.
Matemasie font is inspired by  Adinkra symbol Mate Masie from the Akan people; an ethnic group from West Africa, primarily from Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire, with the name meaning “What I hear, I keep.” This symbol represents wisdom, knowledge, and wisdom.
